This is not a full fledged malware code, It's just a demo to show how easily anyone can hack into your account.
You can code it in your own language of choice and make it more advanced and stealth.
Still, it's antivirus detection ratio is 0 or say it's FUD because it does not contain any virus signatures nor does
it perform any such malicious activity which the antivirus can find malicious.

The code is written in python and you can make changes and convert it into a single executable by using pyInstaller.
It sends the data back to the attacker using a PHP code hosted on a website.
It's a simple cookie logger php script which I have included here.
 
It's full description here:  

How to setup:
1.setup the cookie logger PHP script on your webhost.
2.change the url field in the malware code.
3.Execute it.

Note: It only works if the user has selected remember me and is currently logged in into his FB account from firefox web browser.
